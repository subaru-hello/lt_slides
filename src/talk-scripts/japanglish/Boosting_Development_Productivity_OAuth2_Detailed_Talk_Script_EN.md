## [0:00-1:00] Introduction

Good evening, everyone! Thank you for joining us at Japanglish Vol.2. My name is subaru, and I'm a software engineer at AI Shift which is one of a CyberAgent Corporation Group.

Today's talk shares a story about how implementing OAuth 2.0 teaches valuable lessons about boosting development productivity. This isn't just a technical talk about OAuth – it's about discovering patterns and practices that can accelerate development, regardless of the specific technology being used.

 Through OAuth implementation to Our product, valuable lessons about development productivity emerged. Here's what happened and the lessons learned along the way.

## [1:00-1:30] The Bottom Line First

Before diving into the details, here's what this talk is really about:

**Three key factors that significantly boosted our development productivity:**

1. **Leveraging Standardized Specifications (RFCs)**
   - Well-debated specs make implementation incredibly easy
   - Years of discussion and refinement already done for you

2. **Creating a Shared Team Language** 
   - Clean Architecture as communication tool
   - Reducing cognitive load for humans AND AI

3. **Investing in Foundation**
   - Automated testing and CI/CD
   - Compound benefits over time

These aren't OAuth-specific lessons. They apply to ANY development project. Now, let me show you how we discovered these through implementing OAuth 2.0 authentication.

## [1:30-3:00] Background and Context

### Product Overview

First, some context about what's being built. Our company develops an AI agent platform with two main components:

**AI Worker** – This is our core service that executes AI agents in production. Think of it as the runtime environment where agents actually do their work.

**AI Studio** – This is our development environment where users can prototype and test AI agents before deploying them to production.

Now, here's where the story begins. The requirement was to add authentication and authorization as a cross-service feature that would work seamlessly across both platforms.

### Understanding AI Agents

To ensure everyone understands the development context, here's a brief explanation of AI agents, since this background is crucial for understanding the challenge faced.

Based on the architecture – referencing the  Our website blog – AI agents decompose into four fundamental components:

First, **Instruction** – This defines what the agent should do and how it should behave. It's like the agent's job description.

Second, **Model** – This is the AI model powering the agent, whether it's GPT-4, Claude, or another LLM.

Third, **Memory** – This maintains conversation history and context, allowing the agent to have coherent, contextual interactions.

And fourth, **Tool** – This is where things get interesting. Tools allow agents to interact with external services and APIs. And this – this is exactly where authentication and authorization needed to be added.

When an AI agent uses a tool to access external services – maybe reading your Gmails or accessing a your Outlook Schedules – proper credentials are required. Without authentication, security vulnerabilities emerge. Without authorization, there's no control over what each agent can access. This was the challenge that needed solving.

## [3:00-4:30] OAuth History and the Significance of RFCs

### The Evolution of Auth

Now, when hearing "authentication and authorization," OAuth probably comes to mind – and rightly so. But here's a quick journey through how we got here, because understanding this evolution is crucial to appreciating why OAuth makes development more productive.


**Generation 1: The Dark Ages of Passwords**

Remember when every website required its own username and password? Users had to create separate accounts everywhere. Password fatigue was real. Security was a nightmare. This clearly wasn't sustainable.

**Generation 2: OAuth 1.0 – The First Attempt**

In 2007, Twitter and Google pioneered OAuth 1.0. It was revolutionary – you could grant access without sharing passwords! But here's the thing: it was incredibly complex to implement. 

The HMAC-SHA1 signature process required normalizing query parameters in a very specific way. Every request needed a precisely calculated signature. Debugging was a nightmare because one wrong character in the signature base string meant complete failure. Horror stories circulate about engineers spending days debugging OAuth 1.0 implementations.

### OAuth 1.0 vs 2.0: A Complete Overhaul

Now here's something crucial to understand: OAuth 2.0 isn't just OAuth 1.0 with improvements. It's a complete redesign from the ground up. Let me show you what changed:

**First, the signature nightmare disappeared.** OAuth 1.0 required HMAC-SHA1 signatures for every single request. You had to normalize parameters, calculate base strings, and one wrong character meant total failure. OAuth 2.0 said "forget all that - just use HTTPS." Simple Bearer tokens replaced complex cryptographic signatures.

**Second, token lifecycle completely changed.** OAuth 1.0 tokens could last a year or even forever - imagine the security risk if one got compromised! OAuth 2.0 introduced short-lived access tokens, typically lasting minutes to hours, paired with refresh tokens. This means even if a token is stolen, it expires quickly.

**Third, flexibility through multiple flows.** OAuth 1.0 had one flow that you had to make work for everything. OAuth 2.0 provides different flows for different scenarios - Authorization Code for web apps, Client Credentials for machine-to-machine, and more. Each optimized for its use case.

**Fourth, architectural separation.** OAuth 1.0 tightly coupled authorization and resource servers. OAuth 2.0 separates them, allowing independent scaling and deployment.

The bottom line? OAuth 2.0 isn't an evolution - it's a revolution. And this complete redesign is exactly what made it so much more productive to implement.

**Generation 3: OAuth 2.0 – The Game Changer**

Then in 2012, OAuth 2.0 arrived as RFC 6749. The IETF took all the lessons learned from OAuth 1.0 and created something beautifully simple. By assuming HTTPS everywhere, they could eliminate the complex signature process. They provided multiple flows for different use cases. Implementation became dramatically easier.

It ditched OAuth 1.0's complex signatures and relies solely on HTTPS for security. 

It uses short-lived tokens.

It offers more authorization flows to accommodate different kinds of apps, from web mobile and desktop apps to APIs. 

Because of these changes, the way you do authorization using OAuth 2.0 is quite different from the way you would do it using OAuth 1.0. With OAuth 2.0:


You don’t need to sign requests.

You don’t have to make a single authentication flow work for all your apps.

You now need to implement token state management to refresh expired tokens.

**Generation 4: OAuth 2.1 – The Future**

And now, we're moving toward OAuth 2.1, currently in draft as draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1. It's taking all the security best practices we've learned over the past decade and baking them into the core spec. PKCE is becoming mandatory. The insecure flows are being removed. It's evolution in action.

### Why RFCs Matter

Now, you might wonder – why discuss RFCs in a productivity talk? Here's why: RFCs, or Request for Comments, are one of the most powerful productivity tools available to engineers.

An RFC represents the collective wisdom of the global engineering community. When you implement something based on an RFC, you're not just following a specification – you're leveraging years of debate, review, and real-world testing by thousands of engineers.

For OAuth alone, we have RFC 6749 for the core framework, RFC 6750 for bearer tokens, RFC 7636 for PKCE, and many more. Plus, we have OpenID Connect built on top of OAuth for authentication.

This meant designing an auth system from scratch wasn't necessary. A blueprint created by experts, tested by the industry, and proven in production was already available. That's a massive productivity boost right there.

## [4:30-8:00] Three Phases That Boosted Development Productivity

### Phase 1: Design (2 minutes)

So let's talk about how this was actually implemented. The process breaks down into three phases: Design, Implementation, and Release.

#### The Power of Established Specifications

In the design phase, having OAuth 2.0's RFC was like having an expert architect on the team. The spec clearly defines four actors: the Resource Owner (our users), the Client (our AI agents), the Authorization Server (where credentials are validated), and the Resource Server (the external APIs).

It also provides multiple authorization flows. After analyzing the requirements, the Authorization Code flow was chosen. Why? AI Worker runs on servers where credentials can be securely stored. Refresh tokens were needed for long-running agents. And with PKCE support, there would be defense against authorization code interception attacks.

The RFC even specifies security considerations. Use a state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks – check. Implement proper redirect URI validation – check. Set appropriate token expiration times – check. It's like having a security checklist built right into the specification.

#### The Value of Team Support

But here's something crucial: even with great specifications, being new to the company – I just joined AI Shift a month ago at the time – presented challenges. This is where team support became invaluable.

Creating sequence diagrams using Claude Code Max allowed instant sharing on Slack for design reviews. Team members who understood the architecture deeply could quickly spot potential issues. "Hey, that won't work with our current session management," someone might say. Or "Our AI Studio uses a different token format – here's how to handle that."

This real-time collaboration meant the design process wasn't happening in isolation. Leveraging the collective knowledge of the team while following industry standards proved to be a powerful combination.

### Phase 2: Implementation (2 minutes)

#### Clean Architecture: The Productivity Multiplier

Now, here's where things get really interesting. The codebase follows Clean Architecture principles, and this turned out to be a massive productivity booster.

Picture this: In Clean Architecture, there are clear layers: Presentation at the top, then Application with use cases, then Domain with business logic, and Infrastructure at the bottom for external services.

But here's the key insight: **Clean Architecture isn't just about code organization – it's about creating a shared language for your team.**

Saying "OAuth token validation goes in the Use Case layer" immediately conveyed the intention to everyone. No lengthy explanations needed. When asking where to put the token refresh logic, the team could quickly guide: "That's infrastructure, but expose it through a domain interface."

This shared understanding dramatically reduced communication overhead. Code reviews became faster because reviewers knew exactly where to look for each piece of functionality. New team members could understand the codebase structure immediately.

And here's something fascinating: this architecture also improved interactions with AI coding assistants. Given the architecture context, Claude could generate code and GPT-4 could design higher level of OAuth data flows  that fit perfectly into the layers. The clear separation of concerns reduced the AI's cognitive load, making it more effective.

#### Testing as a Productivity Tool

The testing strategy was another productivity multiplier. With Clean Architecture, each layer could be tested independently. Testing OAuth flows with mock authorization servers became straightforward. Verifying business logic without hitting real APIs was possible.

But here's the real productivity gain: having comprehensive test coverage for both happy paths and edge cases. Reviewers could quickly scan through the test suite and verify that expected scenarios were covered. "Should refresh access token when expired" - check. "Should reject invalid state parameter" - check.

While we didn't dive deep into every test implementation, just seeing that normal and error cases were handled gave reviewers confidence. This coverage check was incredibly helpful. Reviewers felt confident approving code when they saw comprehensive tests passing. Less back-and-forth meant faster iterations.

### Phase 3: Release (1.5 minutes)

#### CI/CD: The Final Accelerator

The final phase was release, and the CI/CD pipeline was the last piece of the productivity puzzle.

Every push triggered automatic linting, type checking, and the full test suite. But here's what really reduced the burden: **Gemini was integrated into our CI pipeline for automated first-pass code reviews**. This AI-powered review caught common issues before human reviewers even looked at the code, significantly reducing review burden.

And since our product runs on Kubernetes, we implemented GitOps with ArgoCD. Once code is merged to the main branch, ArgoCD automatically syncs and deploys to our clusters. No manual deployment steps, no kubectl commands - just merge and watch it go live.

This automation enabled fearless iteration. Making a change, getting AI feedback, pushing it, and seeing it automatically deployed became the norm. No manual testing across different environments. No "works on my machine" problems.

The result? Significantly improved development efficiency, achieved not through cutting corners, but through leveraging standards, architecture, and automation.

## [8:00-9:00] Key Learnings and Takeaways

So what are the key lessons from this experience? Here are three critical factors that boost development productivity:

**First: Leverage Standardized Specifications**

When specifications have been thoroughly debated and refined over years, implementation becomes surprisingly easy. Whether it's OAuth RFCs, web standards, or industry best practices, these specifications have already solved countless edge cases through rigorous discussion. The hard thinking has been done – you just need to implement. This isn't about avoiding work – it's about recognizing that years of collective debate have already produced optimal solutions.

**Second: Harness Your Team's Knowledge**

No matter how good you are individually, you'll be more productive with team support. But this requires creating structures for knowledge sharing. Regular design reviews, clear documentation, and open communication channels are infrastructure investments that pay massive productivity dividends.

**Third: Invest in Architecture and Tooling**

Clean Architecture gave us a shared language. Automated testing gave us confidence. CI/CD gave us speed. These aren't just nice-to-haves – they're productivity multipliers that compound over time.

## [9:00-10:00] Closing Thoughts

Reflecting on this experience reveals something important. Having joined the company just a month prior, initial concerns about lacking product context were natural. How could someone contribute effectively without understanding all the system intricacies?

But this project demonstrated that with the right foundations – standardized specifications, supportive team structures, and good architecture – even new engineers can deliver significant value quickly.

The evolution of OAuth from 1.0 to 2.0 to the upcoming 2.1 shows us that technology continuously improves. Each iteration learns from the last, making life easier for developers. We should embrace this same philosophy in our work.

So whether you're implementing OAuth, building AI agents, or tackling any other technical challenge, remember: stand on the shoulders of giants, leverage your team's wisdom, and invest in the foundations that will accelerate not just your current project, but every project that follows.

Thank you for listening, and hopefully these lessons help boost your own development productivity. Looking forward to discussing more during the networking session after the talks.
