# What a Box Do

Nowadays, transporting and storing technologies have evolved a lot.

We can transport and store almost anything.
This is because a variety of boxes have been invented.

A natural question is what kinds of boxes have been invented historically.

This talk explores the history of the box. And in the end, The goal is to grasp the role of boxes.

The concept of a box is very broad. 

First, clarify the meaning step by step.

Start with a definition.

Right, without a doubt, Box, Inc., is the most famous “thing” that you imagine when you hear "Box", but at this moment that is not the one.

Do you know the definition of “box”?

Right, it was easy. Just type "a box definition" into a search bar.
> A box (plural: boxes) is a container with rigid sides used for the storage or transportation of its contents.
> (c.f: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box)

A box is a container... Container, well, let me search a container.

### What are containers?
> A container is any receptacle or enclosure for holding a product used in storage, packaging, and transportation, including shipping.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container

“Container” is more appropriate as today’s topic, since it’s a more abstract term.

Wikipedia also covers a variety of similar containers. So varieties of containers.

big vs. small; soft vs. hard; circular vs. rectangular; many doors vs. one.

Containers are so useful that it has produced many use cases and evolved to meet many needs.

This section emphasizes the more abstract concept of “what containers do.”.

### What containers do

Containers preserve contents, buffer against uncertainty, just contain something at short or long moments, hide something, bundle sparsed things.

Thinking with such ways, containers not just contain values inside but isolate contents to protect them from the outside.

### Why we use containers
Imagine you’re transporting a crystal glass. 

You might wrap it in plastic vinyl and package it carefully. 

At this time, the packaging might protect the contents for at most about a week—relatively short.

What about a gold bar?

I would put that into a hard and a hardened vault with multiple layers of security so it isn’t stolen or broken. 

A bank vault is a better place; it offers multiple security checks to withdraw the property. 

Less frequent to withdraw, relatively long-term, if you are not suffering from money.

When you hear “containers,” you probably think of shipping containers first.

Some may be small; others may be big enough to hold huge amounts of groceries.

They’re easy to stack and separate efficiently.
They are tough. 

You can’t tell what’s inside unless you open it, so you label containers—e.g., your company logo, stickers that have the sender’s and receiver’s names, or barcodes metadata will seen when you scan.

As long as you can distinguish your container from others, labels can be anything you like. 

According to the World Shipping Council, shipping operations follow roughly this process:

Receive an order from a customer → 
Arrange ordered ingredients from warehouse to truck → Pack ingredients into a container → 
load containers onto a ship → 
transport them to the destination port → 
unload them at the port → clear customs → 
unpack the containers → 
load the contents onto trucks → 
deliver them to the customer warehouse.

So, a shipping container has to endure high pressures from outside.

Some people live in container homes, well equipped with furniture. 
Inside of a container, you can ignore the outside world. From the outside, you might not think someone lives in a container. 
containers could serve as a house.

Up to this point, we've found that containers have several roles.
They play roles such as packing goods that match a customer’s order, and because of broad customer needs, containers have evolved such diversity.

I want to simplify their roles here.

preserve contents by protecting them from the outside; standardize properties and shapes to deliver them efficiently with portability; and remain independent of complex operations.

They handle many packaging workloads; in turn, they’re well standardized with simple structures.

So, I see containers as a “portable place to preserve original value.”

### Summary
a container is more abstract mean for a box.
Containers do preserve, isolate, bundle, hide, buffer uncertainty, work for short-or long-term horizons.

### Containers, In the art of computer science
So much for today. We focused on real-world workloads; The computer-science part will be covered next time.

Thank you for listening.
